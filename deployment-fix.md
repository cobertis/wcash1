# Deployment Fix for Walgreens Offers Explorer

## Problem Analysis
The deployed version shows "Internal Server Error" which typically indicates:
1. TypeScript compilation errors in production
2. Missing dependencies in production build
3. Environment variable issues
4. Database connection problems

## LSP Errors Fixed
âœ… Corrected property access errors in routes.ts:
- Fixed `startDate`/`endDate` â†’ `start`/`end` in redeemedOffersSchema
- Fixed `access_token` â†’ `accessToken` property names
- Fixed WebSocket method existence checks
- Fixed storage method return types

## Deployment Optimizations Applied

### 1. Created Production Configuration Files
- `replit.toml` - Replit deployment configuration
- `production-start.js` - Production startup script with error handling

### 2. Health Check Improvements
Enhanced health check endpoints in `server/index.ts`:
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/healthz` - Kubernetes-style health check
- `/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/ping` - Simple ping endpoint

### 3. Build Process Improvements
The build process includes:
- Frontend compilation with Vite
- Backend bundling with esbuild
- Production environment variables
- Error handling for missing build artifacts

## Next Steps for User
1. **Cancel current deployment** if it's still running
2. **Deploy again** using the Deploy button in Replit
3. The deployment should now work correctly with all fixes applied

## Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in deployment:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (should be automatically provided by Replit)
- `WALGREENS_API_KEY` and related API keys

## Monitoring
The production logs will show:
- "ðŸš€ Starting Walgreens Offers Explorer in production mode..."
- Health check responses
- API endpoint availability

If deployment still fails, check the deployment logs for specific error messages.
